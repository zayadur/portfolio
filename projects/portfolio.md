[learn more about Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs)

`npm run dev` to run the development environment.\
`npm run build` to build a public distribution.\
`npm run start` to start a production server.

 Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project hosted on your environment.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/test](http://localhost:3000/api/test). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/test.jsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
